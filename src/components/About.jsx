                    <h3>Dev Journey</h3>
                    <p>My journey as a software developer began in 2020, sparked by the possibility of creating innovative and visually appealing solutions from scratch. I first delved into the basics of web design before diving into frontend development and grasping the fundamentals of backend development. Motivated by my passion for the field, I relocated from Belgrade to Stockholm and am proud to have undergone extensive training with the Salt Academy to become a proficient JavaScript developer. I am now privileged to be part of an esteemed programming team in Stockholm as a Frontend Developer, where I continually refine my skills and drive to innovate.</p>

                    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                    <p>Growing up, my biggest love was indoor sports like volleyball, basketball and recently discovered Ultimate Frisbee. When I am not hanging out with friends or working out at the gym, I spend my time playing piano with the most amazing audience ever - my two dog friends. The rest of my time is somehow spent in the kitchen creating culinary experiments accompanied by dance moves from a younger time when I was a professional hip-hopper. I consider myself a versatile person and a nature lover, so a middsommar celebration with friends and some interesting topics is like a tailor-made for me.</p>
